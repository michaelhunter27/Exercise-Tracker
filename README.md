# Exercise Tracker
## About
This is a web application I made for my web development class. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React and Node.js). The app supports Create, Read, Update and Delete operations for exercise logs.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

```
The server side will run on port 3000.

With both parts running, view the app at http://localhost:8000/.
